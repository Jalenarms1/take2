# Code Refactor Starter Code

Semantic elements were inserted to label the code according to how it is laid out on the page.

The href on the first list item had a class selector instead of the necessary id that would need in order to locate that section on the page.

I also organized each element that included long lines of text, by shortening the width of each section on the html document.

The css file was organized to group together each styling according to the section on the page it was relative to.
